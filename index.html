            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Raine, a seasoned lead repair technician based in the Rochester, NY area, with extensive experience in tech repair and a deep passion for both modern and vintage technology. At uBreakiFix by Asurion, I oversee a talented team, ensuring that our clients’ devices are not only repaired but optimized for long-term performance. My expertise spans a wide array of devices, from the latest smartphones and computers to retro systems, blending innovative solutions with a love for technology’s past.</p>
            <p>Beyond my technical role, I’m an advocate for digital minimalism and thoughtful tech integration. Whether it’s setting up a dual-boot system to run legacy software or using 3D printing to customize and enhance hardware, I bring a creative and problem-solving mindset to everything I do.</p>
            <p>I hold a degree in Fish and Wildlife Technology, which aligns with my commitment to sustainability and the responsible use of technology. This perspective also fuels my interest in transhumanism—since I strongly believe that technology can have a positive and ethical impact on the future of society and the planet.</p>
